## Features 🚀

The **Online Quiz Management System** is a software solution that allows a particular institute to arrange, conduct, and manage quizzes via online environment. This can be done through the internet or Local Area Network environments. Some of the problems faced by manual quiz systems are delays in result processing, filtering of results is not easy, and the chance of loss of records is high. Also, record searching is difficult. Maintenance of the system is also very difficult and takes a lot of time and effort. In this system, a candidate can give an online quiz on a particular topic and get the results instantly through which the user can know their potentials and how much more effort they need to put in to get better marks.
